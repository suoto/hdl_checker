`hdlcc` provides a Python API between a VHDL project and some HDL compilers to
catch errors and warnings the compilers generate that can be used to populate
syntax checkers and linters of text editors.

`hdlcc` automates tasks when possible. Currently, this means

* Taking dependencies into account when building so you don't need to provide a
  source list ordered by hand.
* Finding and rebuilding sources and design units that the compiler says are out
  of date (typically rebuilding sources that depend on package that has been
  changed)
* Easily switch between different compilers

## Installation

This is mostly up to you. Common methods:

* Git submodule

    ```sh
    $ cd your/repo/path
    $ git submodule add https://github.com/suoto/hdlcc your/repo/submodules/path
    $ git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```

* Python distutils

    ```sh
    $ git clone https://github.com/suoto/hdlcc
    $ pip install hdlcc
    ```

---

## Usage

`hdlcc` requires a configuration file listing libraries, source files, build flags,
etc. See the [wiki](https://github.com/suoto/hdlcc/wiki#project-file-formats) for
details on how to write it.

Besides that, it can be used [standalone](#standalone) or [within Python](#within-python).

### Standalone

Installing `hdlcc` via pip allows running it as a standalone command.

```shell
$ hdlcc -h
usage: hdlcc [-h] [--verbose] [--clean] [--build]
                [--sources [SOURCES [SOURCES ...]]] [--debug-print-sources]
                [--debug-print-compile-order] [--debug-parse-source-file]
                [--debug-run-static-check]
                [--debug-profiling [OUTPUT_FILENAME]]
                project_file

positional arguments:
  project_file          Configuration file that defines what should be built
                        (lists sources, libraries, build flags and so on

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --verbose, -v         Increases verbose level. Use multiple times to
                        increase more
  --clean, -c           Cleans the project before building
  --build, -b           Builds the project given by <project_file>
  --sources [SOURCES [SOURCES ...]], -s [SOURCES [SOURCES ...]]
                        Source(s) file(s) to build individually
  --debug-print-sources
  --debug-print-compile-order
  --debug-parse-source-file
  --debug-run-static-check
  --debug-profiling [OUTPUT_FILENAME]
```

### Within Python

Full API docs are not yet available. The example below should get you started, if
you need more info, check the code or open an issue at the [issue tracker][issue_tracker]
requesting help.

1. Subclass the ```HdlCodeCheckerBase``` class from ```hdlcc.code_checker_base```

    ```python
    from hdlcc.code_checker_base import HdlCodeCheckerBase

    class StandaloneProjectBuilder(HdlCodeCheckerBase):
        _ui_logger = logging.getLogger('UI')
        def handleUiInfo(self, message):
            self._ui_logger.info(message)

        def handleUiWarning(self, message):
            self._ui_logger.warning(message)

        def handleUiError(self, message):
            self._ui_logger.error(message)
    ```

1. Create a project object passing the configuration file as a parameter (for
 static checks only, no configuration file is needed). This triggers the
 project to be built in background

    ```python
    project = StandaloneProjectBuilder('path/to/config/file')
    project.waitForBuild()
    ```

1. You can now build a single file and get records that describe the messages it
 returns

    ```python
    for record in project.getMessagesByPath('path/to/the/source'):
        print "[{error_type}-{error_number}] @ " \
              "({line_number},{column}): {error_message}"\
                .format(**record)
    ```

 That should return something like

    ```
    [E-None] @ (83,30): no declaration for "integer_vector"
    [E-None] @ (83,30): no declaration for "integer_vector"
    [W-0] @ (29,14): constant 'ADDR_WIDTH' is never used
    ```

 (The example above uses GHDL to build
[suoto/hdl_lib/code/memory/testbench/async_fifo_tb.vhd][async_fifo_tb])

## Style checking

Style checks are independent of a third-party compiler. Checking includes:

* Unused signals, constants, generics, shared variables, libraries, types and
 attributes
* Comment tags (`FIXME`, `TODO`, `XXX`)

Notice that currently the unused reports has caveats, namely declarations with
the same name inherited from a component, function, procedure, etc. In the
following example, the signal `rdy` won't be reported as unused in spite of the
fact it is not used.

```vhdl
signal rdy, refclk, rst : std_logic;
...

idelay_ctrl_u : idelay_ctrl
    port map (rdy    => open,
              refclk => refclk,
              rst    => rst);
```
